# JWM themes

A few simple themes for [Joe's Window
Manager](https://joewing.net/projects/jwm/)!

Not that I daily drive these, just having a bit of fun. But I am going to run
them on an old laptop of mine ðŸ™‚

## Installation

These themes assume you're running JWM (obviously) and have
[`xdgmenumaker`](https://github.com/gapan/xdgmenumaker) installed to put all
your applications in the menu. I could just install it through my package
manager. Maybe you can too. Then:

```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:Timendus/jwm-themes.git
```

And then either modify your own `~/.jwmrc` file to hold the contents of
`~/jwm-themes/.jwmrc`, or just copy over my version:

```bash
cp ~/jwm-themes/.jwmrc ~/
```

If you clone this repo somewhere other than your home directory, make sure you
fix the icon and background paths in the `.jwmrc` files.

## Hey Joe!

If you read this, just wanted to let you know that I really enjoyed your TI-83
shell Ion when I was in highschool around 2002 ðŸ˜„ It was miles ahead of the
other shells, and I learned a ton from reading its source code. I'm happy to
have recently discovered your super resource-effective window manager, to bring
back life to my older machines. Thanks!
